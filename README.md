A GUI for controlling DrScientist's DUSK through MIDI:

  - python dusk.py

  - click DUSK or change mode to send current state

  - slider does not send value, use button instead
  - (limits msgs-per-sec sent)

  - uses https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI to send messages
  - thanks gbevin

  - "scrolled frame" is re-organized stack overflow code
  - thanks world
